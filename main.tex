\section{Introduction}
We evaluate , the effects of a dedicated memory allocator on the Linux network stack at 100Gb/s and beyond.
We propose several optimizations which we evaluate rigorously in the next sections. We add a sclable cache for 64KB chunks of memory. The goal of this cache is to shortcut the cumbersome buddy allocator, gaining faster allocation on a single core and minimize contention on multicore. The cache is a generic magazine allocator.
The second optimization we use is adding a page\_frag based, byte grained memory allocator. The page\_frag allocator optimizes cache access patterns.
We also theorize that by using huge pages we can optimize the use of TLB and thus farther optimize the cycles/byte value.
Throughout this work, we refer to the modified kernel with the set of optimizations as \oursys.
